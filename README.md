A Image captioning model used in Altseeker in order to caption Images in HTML. We have used CNN pretrained Inception V3 model to preprocess the Image. Then We have used LSTM network and GRU to decode our thought vector. Also , We have included attention layers as specified in show , attend and tell paper with tensorflow and we have proved our result by using BLEU Score metrics
